/** var
 * var variables can be re-declared and updated
 * Hoisting of var
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

/** let
 * let is block scoped
 * let can be updated but not re-declared.
*Hoisting of let
Just like  var, let declarations are hoisted to the top. Unlike var which is initialized as undefined, the let keyword is not initialized. So if you try to use a let variable before declaration, you'll get a Reference Error.
